# DICE
These reports provide examples of interactive content that can be loaded into the Disconnected Interactive Content Explorer (DICE). They become interactive by downloading the root folder of the report and compressing it into a zip file. 

These are notional reports to show how DICE functions. NGA plans to post official interactive DICE content to streamline disaster and crisis support using commerical applications. 

See the DICE User Guide for more details.
