The user guide is a bit of dogfooding, using a DICE report to show how this app can be used.

This simple example displays a map with local tiles that will work offline, and a video that will show you how you can add new content to DICE, and how you can get any notes you take in the app onto your computer.

Feel free to pull this report out of DICE and poke around in the code.

Resources used to create the user guide: [Bootstrap][bootstrap] for layout and [Leaflet.js][leaflet] for the map.
